1)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.It is the method that computers and servers use to request and send information.
It is used in client-server communication.


HTTP1.1
->Web traffic- faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic if you compare it to Http 1.0
->Performance optimization- sprinting, inlining, domain shrading, and concatenating
->status code-It defines 24 status codes, error reporting is quicker and more efficient
->Authentication Mechanism - Protocol Http 1.1 is much secured than Http 1.0 because it uses digest
 authentication and NTLM authentication
->Security- Digest authentication is an improvement over Http 1.0 which is now being used in Http 1.1.
 Https uses SSL/TLS for secure encrypted communication

HTTP2
->utilizes multiplexing and server pushes to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater margin
 along with being sensitive to network delays
->Performance optimization - removes the need for unnecessary optimization hacks
->Status code-It brings the fundamental semantics of HTTP like headers, and status code remains the same
->Authentication Mechanism - Rather Http 2 is better equipped to deal with security threats because of the
 new features it brings
->Security - the security is encrypted since all almost all clients demand traffic to be encrypted. It has
 minimum standards and minimum key size for encryption.

From the above comparison, Http 2 is securer than Http 1.1

2)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

The object is an important data-type in and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
The object is a Composite data type and is quite different as compared to the primitive data types 
like Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol.

Objects are very complex and it contains any combination of these primitive data-types as well as 
reference data-types.
The object is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference
 or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.

The objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data in the form of key-value pairs. T
he keys can be variable or functions and they are called properties and methods.respectively.

The Object can be created by using brackets {}. The property is a “key: value” pair, where the key is a string 
( called a “property name”), and value can be anything.
