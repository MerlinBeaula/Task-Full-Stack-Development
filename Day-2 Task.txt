Write a blog on the Difference between document & window objects?
#Window - It is a parent object.
          It's not available on node environment, available only on browser JS.
          It can be accessed by window.document or document.
          We can access the HTML document used on the web page.
#Document - It is a child of window.
            It's available on node JS.
            It can be accessed by document.
            We can access any HTML document through this document object.
